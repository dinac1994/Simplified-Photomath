# Simplified-Photomath

This repository includes a simplified version of a popular educational app called Photomath. A user uploads a picture containing a handwritten mathematical expression and the program returns the solution of the given expression.

Expression can contain following mathematical characters: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `+`, `-`, `Ã—`, `(` and `)`.

### There are four parts of this code:

1.  **A handwritten character detector function** - receives an image of expression and returns cropped images of characters

2.  **A Classification Function** - recieves cropped image of a character and returns a character. We will use a CNN for classification that was made and trained in a `NN_model.ipynb` file.

3.  **An Evaluation Function** - recieves a string of characters that represent an expression and returns the evaluation of the expression

4.  **A Photomath Function** - this function includes all of the previous functions. It takes an image of a handwritten expression and outputs a solution of the given expression.

## Part One - Handwritten Character Detector Function

### Output: "2"

## Part Three - An Evaluation Function

### Input: "2+3"

### Output: "5"

## Part Four - A Photomath Function

This is where everything gets together!

### Input:

From the input image, we get cropped images of the characters using ***Character Detector Function***.

We then iterate through all of the cropped images of characters and we classify each image as a character (using  ***Classification Function*** and we append those characters to one string. That string is going to be a math expression from the image.

The final step is to use ***Evaluation Function*** that takes the expression string and solves it. The final output is the solution of the expression.

### Output: "5".
